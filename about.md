I work on the [aloha](https://github.com/eharmony/aloha) open source project I started at 
[eHarmony](http://www.eharmony.com) where I was a Senior Machine Learning engineer.  I am also working on 
[scifn](https://gihub.com/scifn/scifn) (pronounced *ˈsīfən*) as a way of synthesizing functions from string 
descriptions.  [scifn](https://gihub.com/scifn/scifn) will hopefully act as a replacement to
[aloha](https://github.com/eharmony/aloha)'s code generation module.
 
Check out [deaktator @ github](https://github.com/deaktator).  I also have a cool repository on techniques 
for rewarding and penalizing matches edges in bipartite graph max-flow problems.  See my 
[maxflow-problems](https://github.com/deaktator/maxflow-problems) github repo for more information.

Take a look at the slides from my [Testing in an Unsure World]({{site.url}}/presentations/prob-testing) talk I 
gave at eHarmony.

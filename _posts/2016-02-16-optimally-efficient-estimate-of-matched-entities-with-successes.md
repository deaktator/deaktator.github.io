Given a set of matches with success probabilities: 

$$
\left\{ \left( a,b,p \right) \lvert \quad a\in A,b\in B,p=Pr\left[ { \text{success} \left( \left( a,b \right)  \right)  } \right] \right\}    
$$

one might want to estimate the number of elements in $$ A $$, $$ B $$, or $$ A \cup B $$ that are involved in a 
successful match.  Done naively, this involves calculating an expectation that is as complex to calculate as 
calculating the [PMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function) of the 
[Poisson binomial distribution]({% post_url 2015-08-09-poisson-binomial-distribution %}).  We can sum 
$$ \text{ops}(n,k) $$, from the previous post [Poisson binomial distribution]({% post_url 2015-08-09-poisson-binomial-distribution %}), 
over $$ k=0,1,\dots ,n $$ to get: 
 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{ops}(n) &= \sum _{ k=0 }^{ n }{ \left( \underbrace { \left( \begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix} \right)  }_{ terms } \left( \underbrace { \left( n-k \right)  }_{ subtractions } +\underbrace { \left( n-1 \right)  }_{ multiplications }  \right) +\underbrace { \left( \left( \begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix} \right) -1 \right)  }_{ additions } +\underbrace { \left( \begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix} \right)  }_{ exp\quad mult }  \right)  } \\ 
 &= { 2 }^{ n } + 3 \times { 2 }^{ n-1 }n - n - 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Where we add in the multiplication operations necessary to calculate the expectation.  This shows that when calculated 
na√Øvely, it would take an exponential amount of operations to calculate the number of entities with a success.

## Example 1

![ac_bd]({{ site.url }}/assets/20160216/ac_bd.png)

Let's say that we are doing [biparitite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph) matching and we've produced 
the following matches: 

$$ \left\{ \left(a, c, p_{ac} \right), \left(b, d, p_{bd} \right) \right\} $$

Then we can determine the number of entities expected to see at least one success with the following formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 \times \left( 1-{ p }_{ ac } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ bd } \right) + \\ 
2 \times \left( 1-{ p }_{ ac } \right) { p }_{ bd }+2{ p }_{ ac }\left( 1-{ p }_{ bd } \right) + \\ 
4 \times { p }_{ ac }{ p }_{ bd }
\end{aligned}
$$

The probabilities (on the right) should be familiar to those who've seen the 
[Poisson binomial distribution]({% post_url 2015-08-09-poisson-binomial-distribution %}).  The coefficients 
$$ \left\{ 0, 2, 2, 4 \right\} $$ need some explaining.  In this example, we're ascribing the successful events, when 
they occur, to both entities involved in the match.  The coefficient is the number of unique entities that appear in
***success*** probability subscripts of each term or [addend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addend).  For instance, in 
the first line, there are no success probabilities, only failure probabilities, so the coefficient is $$ 0 $$.  $$ b $$
and $$ d $$ occur in the second term so the coefficient is 2; $$ a $$ and $$ c $$ occur in the third term so the 
coefficient is 2; $$ a $$, $$ d $$, $$ c $$ and $$ d $$ occur in the fourth term so the coefficient is 4.  The 
expectation, once simplified is $$ 2 p_{ac} + 2 p_{bd} $$.

## Example 2

![ac_ad_bc_bd]({{ site.url }}/assets/20160216/ac_ad_bc_bd.png)

This example has the following matches:

$$ \left\{ \left(a, c, p_{ac} \right), \left(a, d, p_{ad} \right), \left(b, c, p_{bc} \right), \left(b, d, p_{bd} \right) \right\} $$

and the expectation calculation, as calculated in the previous example, becomes: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 \times \left( 1-{ p }_{ ac } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ ad } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ bc } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ bd } \right) + \\[0.5cm]

2 \times \left( 1-{ p }_{ ac } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ ad } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ bc } \right) { p }_{ bd }+ \\
2 \times \left( 1-{ p }_{ ac } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ ad } \right) { p }_{ bc }\left( 1-{ p }_{ bd } \right) + \\
2 \times \left( 1-{ p }_{ ac } \right) { p }_{ ad }\left( 1-{ p }_{ bc } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ bd } \right) + \\
2 \times { p }_{ ac }\left( 1-{ p }_{ ad } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ bc } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ bd } \right) + \\[0.5cm]

3 \times \left( 1-{ p }_{ ac } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ ad } \right) { p }_{ bc }{ p }_{ bd }+ \\
3 \times \left( 1-{ p }_{ ac } \right) { p }_{ ad }\left( 1-{ p }_{ bc } \right) { p }_{ bd }+ \\
4 \times \left( 1-{ p }_{ ac } \right) { p }_{ ad }{ p }_{ bc }\left( 1-{ p }_{ bd } \right) + \\
4 \times { p }_{ ac }\left( 1-{ p }_{ ad } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ bc } \right) { p }_{ bd }+ \\
3 \times { p }_{ ac }\left( 1-{ p }_{ ad } \right) { p }_{ bc }\left( 1-{ p }_{ bd } \right) + \\
3 \times { p }_{ ac }{ p }_{ ad }\left( 1-{ p }_{ bc } \right) \left( 1-{ p }_{ bd } \right) + \\[0.5cm]

4 \times \left( 1-{ p }_{ ac } \right) { p }_{ ad }{ p }_{ bc }{ p }_{ bd }+ \\
4 \times { p }_{ ac }\left( 1-{ p }_{ ad } \right) { p }_{ bc }{ p }_{ bd }+ \\
4 \times { p }_{ ac }{ p }_{ ad }\left( 1-{ p }_{ bc } \right) { p }_{ bd }+ \\
4 \times { p }_{ ac }{ p }_{ ad }{ p }_{ bc }\left( 1-{ p }_{ bd } \right) + \\[0.5cm]

4 \times { p }_{ ac }{ p }_{ ad }{ p }_{ bc }{ p }_{ bd }
\end{aligned}
$$

which simplifies to: 

$$
2 p_{ac} + 2 p_{ad} - 
  p_{ac} p_{ad} + 2 p_{bc} - 
  p_{ac} p_{bc} + 2 p_{bd} - 
  p_{ad} p_{bd} - p_{bc} p_{bd}
$$

This calculation, while accurate is requires exponential runtime and it requires an understanding of the topology of 
graph as well to determine the coefficients.
 
## A Better Way

When thinking about what we're trying to accomplish, it should be pretty clear that we are trying to determine the 
expectation of the number of entities in at least one successful match.  The probability of an entity being involved 
in at least one successful match is one minus the probability of being involved in zero successful matches.  So, if
for an entity, $$ a $$, we aggregate the matches involving $$ a $$, we can write the probability of $$ a $$ being
in at least one successful match as: 

$$ 1 - \sum _{ i\in { M }_{ a } }{ \left( 1-{ p }_{ ai } \right) } \\quad (1) $$

where $$ M_{i} $$ is the set of matches involving $$ a $$.  Then if we want to calculate the distribution of the 
number entities involved in at least one successful match, the appropriate distribution is the
[Poisson binomial distribution]({% post_url 2015-08-09-poisson-binomial-distribution %}).  The expectation of the 
Poisson binomial distribution is just the some of the success probabilities that parameterize the distribution.  See
the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_binomial_distribution) for details. So, if we want to 
calculate the expectation, we take the some of the probabilities of the entity being in at least one successful match.  
This is just

$$
\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ \left( 1-\sum _{ j\in { M }_{ i } }{ \left( 1-{ p }_{ ij } \right)  }  \right)  } 
$$

It may not be immediately obvious but this algorithm is $$ O(N) $$ where $$ N $$ is the number of matches.  Here's the
algorithm

### Algorithm

1. Create a hash map with entity IDs for keys and a hash set of probabilities for each match involving the entity ID in the associated map key. 
1. For each match: $$ \left(i, j, p_{ij} \right) $$, place $$ p_{ij} $$ in the set associated with key $$ i $$
   (Optionally, place $$ p_{ij} $$ in the set associated with key $$ j $$, if the match is ascribed to both entities).
1. For each *key-value* pair in the map, calculate the probability of at least one successful match using 
   **equation 1**. 
1. Sum the resultant probabilities.

Since we only ever iterate over the match probabilities twice, and hash map and hash set insertion and iteration is
$$ O(1) $$ per operation, the algorithm is $$ O(N) $$ 

### Equivalence

$$ 
\left(1 - \left(1 - p_{ac} \right) \right) + \\
\left(1 - \left(1 - p_{bd} \right) \right) + \\
\left(1 - \left(1 - p_{ac} \right) \right) + \\
\left(1 - \left(1 - p_{bd} \right) \right)
$$

simplifies to $$ 2 p_{ac} + 2 p_{bd} $$.  *AND*

$$
\left(1 - \left(1 - p_{ac}\right)*\left(1 - p_{ad} \right) \right) + \\
\left(1 - \left(1 - p_{bc}\right)*\left(1 - p_{bd} \right) \right) + \\
\left(1 - \left(1 - p_{ac}\right)*\left(1 - p_{bc} \right) \right) + \\
\left(1 - \left(1 - p_{ad}\right)*\left(1 - p_{bd} \right) \right)
$$

simplifies to

$$
2 p_{ac} + 2 p_{ad} - 
  p_{ac} p_{ad} + 2 p_{bc} - 
  p_{ac} p_{bc} + 2 p_{bd} - 
  p_{ad} p_{bd} - p_{bc} p_{bd}
$$

*These are the same as the expectations from the naive calculation.*

## Remarks

There's something really satisfying about this algorithm, not only because of the linear rather than exponential 
runtime, but also because it doesn't have to do keep track of what entities are connected to each other after grouping
the matches by entity ID.  This not only makes the algorithm much faster, but it's much simpler conceptually.
